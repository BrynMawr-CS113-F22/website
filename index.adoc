== Course Info

**Welcome to CS113**, an introduction to computer science. This class covers 
the basics of computer programming using Java. Students will learn 
fundamental programming concepts, such as variables, conditional statements, 
loops, functions, and classes. Students will develop their ability to write 
programs to solve a variety of problems, read existing programs, 
and find and fix errors in existing code. 

No prior computer programming experience is necessary or expected for this
class. If you have never programmed, or don't know much about computers, this
class is for YOU! However, we do ask students to have "quantitative readiness
(QA)". In this course, QA means a willingness to confront equations and
concepts with curiosity. Students may need to do additional learning outside
of class if they encounter mathematical concepts to which they do not have
previous exposure.

Computer programmers must mix systematic thinking with creativity. Programming 
can be time-consuming and difficult work, but the results are rewarding!  

_This course is appropriate for all students who want to learn how to read, write, 
and debug computer programs as well as learn solve problems like a computer scientist_.
